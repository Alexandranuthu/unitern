## ABOUT UNITERN
In the current landscape, alumni face challenges in effectively showcasing their skills, experiences, and achievements to potential employers. Traditional methods of job
hunting and networking often fall short, leaving graduates struggling to make a meaningful connection with the job market. Furthermore, employers find it difficult to identify and engage with qualified candidates from our alumni pool due to a lack of centralized information.
To address these challenges, we propose the development and implementation of an Alumni
System that empowers graduates to publish and promote their portfolios, fostering easier and
more meaningful connections with the job market. The system will serve as a dynamic platform
where alumni can showcase their professional journey, skills, and accomplishments.
